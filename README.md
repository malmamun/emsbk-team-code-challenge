# emsbk-team-code-challenge
Code challenge for the team.

## Backend
Develop a CLI application in NodeJS/PHP that will do the following:

* Ask for user first and last name
* Ask for user email address and validate it with RegExp
* Ask for user's address and verify the address against some Geocoding API
* Once verification id done, it will print out the information to STDOUT


## Frontend

Develop a web based single page application (SPA) (not SSR or ISOMORPHIC), just static or prerendered. You can use any nodejs or PHP based static server to serve the file. The application will do the following:

* Allow user to upload an image with validation check on MIME type and size of 1024KB.
* Once uploaded, it will show the original image in thumbnail in an HTML element
* It will also show the another version of the same image mirrored along X axis
